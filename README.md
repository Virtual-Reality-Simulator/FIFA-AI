# FIFA-AI
Learning Machine-learning from scratch to training an AI for FIFA

### Overview

All the FIFA lover who has an interest in AI and Machine Learning. I know this is your dream.! To train an Artificial Intelligence that can play FIFA.
This is a step towards the dream. Let's learn and teach what it takes to make AI for FIFA to each other. We will analyse and design how we can make AI, Implement it, make it better each moment and finally Play with it.!!


### Tectics

1. Learn basics of Neural Network with all Python libraries.
2. Learn different types of Neural network, What is the significance and use of it and how to implement them if we want to, with pros and cons
3. Learn different Machine Learning algorithms that we can use to train the AI.
4. Analysis on how we can get input from FIFA and make actions.
5. Connect the FIFA with the artificial brain.
6. Play with it.



### Goal
out goal is to learn Machine-learning with very strong fundamentals. To learn different types of Neural-network and Machine-learning algorithms. To learn how to implement them.

But..

The ultimate goal is to train FIFA AI and Play against it.
